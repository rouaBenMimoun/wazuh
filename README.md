Custom decoders and rules for wazuh
If you're working with wazuh SIEM and have custom log files you may find yourself in a need to create custom decoders and rules to be able to parse and treat these logs.
In this project I'm working on Odoo logs.
Odoo is a comprehensive open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that offers a wide range of business applications and modules to manage various aspects of an organization.
